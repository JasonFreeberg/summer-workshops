## Exercises

1. Fork this repo and submit a Pull Request onto [this file](https://github.com/JasonFreeberg/summer-workshops/blob/main/week1/intros.md). Add some lines to the file with your name, and some notes about what you learned. Example:

    ```md
    # Joe Smith
    - I'm a student and I like to code
    - git is hard, I don't "git" it
    - HTML is a programming language
    - Do I get a job now?
    ```
    
    Add me as a reviewer on your PR. (Remember, other people will be making PRs on this same file, so you may need to refresh your fork of the repo if it gets out-of-sync and someone else added their intro on the same lines your PR is trying to add yours.) 

1. Create a GitHub Pages site for yourself! Photo, about you, link to your LinkedIn. Some resources to get you started:

    - https://guides.github.com/features/pages/
    - Here's mine for reference, but this is a more complicated example: https://github.com/JasonFreeberg/jasonfreeberg.github.io
